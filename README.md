# Emotional-Language

Welcome to **Emotional-Language**, a programming language that brings life and emotions to your code! With `.emo` files, you can express logical operations, loops, and conditions in a unique and intuitive way. Perfect for developers looking to infuse their programming with passion and creativity.

## Features

- **Intuitive Syntax**: Designed to make your code expressive and human-readable.
- **Emotion-Driven Constructs**: Inspired keywords like `mood`, `share`, `endure` (while loop), and `persevere` (for loop).
- **Versatile Data Types**: Supports integers, floats, booleans, and more.
- **Logical Operations**: Use `if` statements and comparisons to control program flow.

## Example Code

Here are some examples showcasing the core features of Emotional-Language:

### If Statements
```emo
mood a = 10
mood b = 20
if a < b
    share("a is less than b")
end
```

### While Loops (`endure`)
```emo
mood counter = 0
endure counter < 5
    share("Counter is:")
    share(counter)
    mood counter = counter + 1
end
share("Endure loop finished")
```

### For Loops (`persevere`)
```emo
persevere i = 1 to 5
    share("i in persevere loop:")
    share(i)
end

persevere j = 0 to 10 step 2
    share("j in persevere loop with step:")
    share(j)
end
share("Persevere loop finished")
```

### Emotional Arithmetic
```emo
mood a = 10
mood b = 20
mood c = a + b * 2
mood d = (a + b) * 2
share(a)
share(b)
share(c)
share(d)
```
